# JBC Station Monitor

## What is this?

This is a tool written in Swift and SwiftUI for monitoring various aspects of JBC's line of Solder and Hot Air stations.  It is based on an on-going reverse engineering of the serial protocol. Since it is currently written as SwiftUI application it only runs on macOS, but there's no reason that the communication part can't be turned into a library that would work anywhere.
